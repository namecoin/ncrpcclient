// Client represents a Namecoin RPC client which allows easy access to the
// various RPC methods available on a Namecoin RPC server.  Each of the wrapper
// functions handle the details of converting the passed and return types to and
// from the underlying JSON types which are required for the JSON-RPC
// invocations
//
// The client provides each RPC in both synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous
// (non-blocking) forms.  The asynchronous forms are based on the concept of
// futures where they return an instance of a type that promises to deliver the
// result of the invocation at some future time.  Invoking the Receive method on
// the returned future will block until the result is available if it's not
// already.

// interested in receiving notifications and will be ignored if the
// configuration is set to run in HTTP POST mode.
